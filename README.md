This currently leaves us with two ideas to explore:
(1) Samson's ETF idea described above.  He linked this full article  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0015198X.2019.1572358 that describes the idea in greater detail.  We discussed looking at different types of ETFs (number of stocks, type of stocks, perhaps looking specifically at ETFs of penny stocks, etc.) and seeing whether the phenomenon is more pronounced with some than with others.
(2) Mike's original project proposal.  As I understand this idea, we'd be looking at daily stock data (open, close, high, low) and see if adding more features from these price trends yields better predictive models.  For example, if we create a feature that examines whether the stock has reached its maximum over the past x days, where x is a hyperparameter we can toy with.   We could theoretically also incorporate Samson's idea by using the stock trends of other stocks in the same ETF as a predictor, but perhaps our intuition is that the phenomenon Samson described would be significant only on small time scales.
